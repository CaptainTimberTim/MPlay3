********* Progress Info - DevLog? *********

22.09.2020
- Fixed shuffle not effecting playing songs, when it was already in playmode.
- Fixed Assert crash when there are more samples to be played than I write every frame (happened on output hardware change). 
- Fixed DisplayCursor not being updated in some situations.
- Cleaned up updating the sliders. Previously you had to always do it manually, which was error prone. Now the function that changes column positions itself handles the slider updates.
- Fixed bringDisplayEntryOnScreen stuff for search. How did that ever work?! Well now it does.

23.09.2020
- Large conversion of file/batch/playlist/displayable arrays to use their own id structs to make it _much_ clearer what is actually happening. This was long overdue for making the code easier to understanding!

24.09.2020
- Fixed bug where you could not properly select new song when a _up next_ song was playing.
- Fixed bug where the end of the song is sometimes cut off.
- Fixed bug where playing song was erroneously evicted and another song started playing in its place.

01.10.2020
- Fixed color not set, when selecting song and no song was playing
- Added DebugTimer feature, to time code blocks via StartTimer() and SnapTimer().
- Added double click for all columns except for song. Double click now selects all slots that are displayed. 
- Added double click for song column. It starts playing the clicked song or pauses it, when it was already playing.

02.10.2020
- Changed QuickSort3 in FillDisplayables to a much simpler RemoveCheckValue, as they actually do not need to be sorted at that point.
- Added a quit animation when pressing Esc. Now it does not just quit, instead you have to hold Esc for 1 second.
- Added quit animation also to alt+f4 and window X button with double speed.

03.10.2020
- Added error messaging for the user. Only for main thead yet.
- Added a error message queue for threading.

04.10.2020
- Added double-escape-press for fast/auto quit.
- Added a "wait for double-escape-press" in animation. 
- When a .mp3 decode/read error is detected and pushed to the user, now it will not crash if the song is pressed again.
- Finally added ReadEndOfFile to extract ID3v1 metadata without reading the entire file.
- Now properly searching for additional metadata in ID3v1, if ID3v2 or ID3v3 do not have all infos.
- Special keyboard key for PlayPause/Stop/Next/Previous are now processed even when application is not focused.
