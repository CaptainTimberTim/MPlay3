MPlay3Settings
Version 6

# NOTE 1:: If you don't want this file and the Library
# file to be in the same directory as the executable, you
# can put them into the '%appdata%\Roaming\MPlay3Data'
# folder. If they can be found -by the program- in
# that specific location, it will overwrite them in there.

# NOTE 2:: If you want to use a different font than the
# default, you can add it here right behind the 'FontPath'
# identifier. Only *.ttf files work! With FontHeightOffset
# the vertical position of the text can be adjusted
# (only integers allowed).
